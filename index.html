                        Welcome to my innovative project—an AI-powered gas
                        cylinder monitoring system designed to tackle a common
                        yet critical challenge faced by many households and
                        businesses across Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our solution introduces smart, real-time monitoring
                        powered by AI and IoT sensors. Users receive timely
                        alerts when gas levels are low, enabling them to plan
                        ahead and avoid unexpected outages. The system provides
                        a user-friendly dashboard accessible via mobile or web,
                        giving individuals and businesses full visibility into
                        their usage patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What makes this project truly impactful is its
                        scalability and adaptability. It can be integrated into
                        smart homes, commercial kitchens, and even gas
                        distribution networks—offering valuable insights that
                        can drive demand forecasting, inventory planning, and
                        safer distribution practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its core, this project is a response to a real
                        problem with a tech-forward solution. We're not just
                        monitoring gas, we're empowering people with convenience
                        and peace of mind.

                    <p class="text-gray-200 text-center mb-2">
                        Hi, I'm Ibukun Odusanya, a Senior Cloud Engineer with a
                        strong background in IT support, ERP systems, and
                        enterprise infrastructure. My journey into tech began
                        with hands-on roles in technical and customer support,
                        where I worked closely with Microsoft 365, internal ERP
                        tools, and retail systems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-200 text-center mb-2">
                        As I advanced in my career, I transitioned into the
                        world of cloud computing driven by a deep curiosity for
                        automation, scalability, and modern DevOps practices.
                        I've since built and maintained secure, reliable
                        infrastructure using tools such as AWS, Terraform,
                        Docker, Kubernetes, and NGINX.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-200 text-center">
                        Today, I bring a balance of technical depth and
                        strategic thinking to every project I work on. I'm
                        always learning, always experimenting, and excited about
                        opportunities that allow me to collaborate, lead, and
                        drive impactful change through cloud technologies.
